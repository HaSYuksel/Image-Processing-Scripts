# Image Compression

This script compresses images to a specified size constraint.

## How It Works

The script reads images from a specified directory, compresses them to below a target file size, and saves them to an output directory. It uses PIL for image manipulation, resizing images and reducing quality iteratively.

## Usage

To use this script, specify the source directory and the target output directory in the script file. Run the script using Python.
